MSTest.TestsLibrary.Testing - An MSTest project that references the MSTest.TestsLibrary library containing test classes.

Are those tests in the library classes runnable by the Visual Studio Test Explorer if the tests project is referenced from a test project?

 NO! The Visual Studio Test Explorer runs tests on each assembly by itself. Thus the library cannot be testing since it is not a test library!
